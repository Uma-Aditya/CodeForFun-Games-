# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Java Console)

A fun console-based number guessing game written in Java. Challenge yourself to guess the correct number based on the difficulty you choose!

## 💡 How It Works

- The game randomly selects a number based on the chosen difficulty level.
- You have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, you'll get a hint whether the number is too high or too low.
- The game keeps track of total games played, games won, and games lost.
- Option to replay as many times as you'd like!
